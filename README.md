IU000146: Computational Inequalities, taught by Joana Chicau & Peaks

  <i> Assessment Brief Details: Element 1 (50%): a technical prototype and reflective documentation. 
Create a prototype of a data-driven artifact that explores bias in AI or other computational inequality. Your prototype could be inspired by one of the topics presented by the lead lecturer or the guest speakers, or it could be on a topic of your own personal interest. The prototype should explore or demonstrate a social issue raised by a computational system using a dataset in some way. The artifact could be a statistical analysis of bias in a dataset, an infographic communicating an issue you find data about, a piece of art that uses a dataset in its design, etc. You are encouraged but not required to define, collect, and curate your own dataset. If you do not collect the data yourself, you will have to find an available existing dataset.
